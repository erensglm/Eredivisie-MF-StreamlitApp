Eredivisie U24 Midfielders

About This Dashboard 

This comprehensive analytics platform provides data-driven insights into Eredivisie's most promising young midfielders (under 24). Using advanced clustering algorithms and statistical analysis, we identify three distinct player profiles to help scouts, analysts, and teams make informed decisions.

Scoring System 
All performance metrics are scored on a 0-100 scale. A score of 0 represents the lowest performance, while 100 represents the highest. For example, a player with 85 in passing demonstrates superior passing ability compared to others in the dataset.
